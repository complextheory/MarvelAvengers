# MarvelAvengers WIKI

A Kotlin App that consumes the [Marvel Characters Api](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started).
Using clean code methodology and principles,
modern Android application tech-stacks
and MVVM architecture. Fetching data from the network 
and persisting data offline. Using dependency injection
to provide components to the various modules using the 
repository pattern.
